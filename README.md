# Socket.IO Blank Interface

A simple demo for socket.io

## How to use

If you don't have `nodemon` installed, you will need to install it first
```
$ npm install -g nodemon
```
(The `-g` tag will install `nodemon` globally.  It is recommended but not necessary.  Actually, `nodemon` isn't strictly necessary either, but it will automatically restart the server whenever a change is made to `index.js`.)

Then run:

```
$ npm ci
$ nodemon index.js
```

And point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. Optionally, specify
a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.
